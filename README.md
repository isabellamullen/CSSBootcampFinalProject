# Project Title

How does environmental vulnerability influence climate change sentiment?

### Description

This project highlights the relationships between the Environmental Justice Index and Yale Climate Opinion Maps. The aim was to explore how environmental vulnerability influences climate change sentiment. 

### Data

* Environmental Justice Index 2022 [data here](https://eji.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/2022/EJI_2022_Data_Dictionary_508.pdf)
* Yale Climate Opinion Maps 2023 [data here](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/)

### Key takeaways:
Peopleâ€™s immediate surroundings (proximity to green space and internet access) and personal health challenges heavily impact climate change sentiment in the US.

* Proximity to Green Space Increases Climate Awareness
  * People living near green spaces are consistently more likely to believe in the reality of global warming, feel they have experienced its effects, discuss it more, and expect greater action from citizens, Congress, and corporations to address climate change.
* Limited Internet Access Reduces Climate Engagement
  * Areas with higher percentages of people lacking internet access show reduced belief in global warming, less personal concern, and lower expectations for action from both individuals and institutions, likely due to limited access to information on climate issues.
* Health Issues Lower Climate Concern
  * Populations with higher rates of health problems, such as mental health challenges, high blood pressure, and diabetes, tend to engage less with climate change, likely because immediate personal health concerns take priority over broader environmental worries.
